# Calculator

## Explanation

- You will be building a calculator which can perform multiple arithmetic operations. Your program should allow the user to choose which operation to perform, enter the values on which the operation is performed, and output the result.

## Specification:

- A user should be given a menu of operations
- A user should be able to choose from the menu
- A user should be able to enter numbers to perform the operation on
- A user should be shown the result
- The menu should be displayed again, and process should continue until the user selects a quit option from the menu

## Starter code !

```ruby 
puts "Welcome to the Calculator!"

def menu
  puts ""
  puts "(a) Addition"
  puts "(d) Divide"
  puts "(s) Subtraction"
  puts "(m) Multiply"
  puts "(x) Exponent"
  puts "(r) Square"
  puts "(q) Quit"
  puts ""
  puts "What operation would you like to perform?"
  gets.chomp # Implicit Return
end

```

### Phase 1

- Calculator functionality
- Calculator should be able to do basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)


### Phase 2

- Advanced Calculator functionality
- Calculator should be able to do complex arithmetic (exponents, square roots, etc.)

## Bonus

### Mortgage Calculator

Calculate the monthly required payment given the other variables as input (look up the necessary variables)

### BMI Calculator

Calculate the body mass index (BMI) for an individual, given their height and weight

### Trip Calculator

Calculate a trip time and cost given inputs for:

- The distance
- Kilometers per litre
- Price per litre
- Speed in kilometers per hour
